# Tondi Standard Proposals (TSP)

The **Tondi Standard Proposal (TSP)** process defines the evolution of the **Tondi blockchain** and its ecosystem.
TSPs are the canonical way to propose, discuss, and standardize protocol-level changes, ecosystem conventions, and governance rules within the Tondi network.

## üìå What is a TSP?

A **TSP (Tondi Standard Proposal)** is a design document that provides information to the Tondi community or describes a new feature for the Tondi chain, its consensus, or its ecosystem.
Each TSP should:

* Provide a **clear technical specification** of the change or feature.
* Explain the **motivation and rationale** behind it.
* Describe any **backward compatibility** and **security considerations**.
* Define the **implementation and activation plan**.

TSPs are the primary mechanism for standardizing the Tondi protocol and ensuring long-term coherence of the ecosystem.

## üìñ Proposal Workflow

A TSP moves through several stages in its lifecycle:

1. **Draft** ‚Äì Initial version, open for feedback.
2. **Review / Last Call** ‚Äì Under technical review and community discussion.
3. **Accepted** ‚Äì Approved for inclusion in a future Tondi release.
4. **Implemented** ‚Äì Implemented in reference clients and/or testnet.
5. **Final (Active)** ‚Äì Successfully deployed and active on mainnet.
6. *(Optional)* **Replaced / Deprecated** ‚Äì Superseded by another TSP.

## üìÇ TSP Categories

TSPs are grouped into categories, depending on their scope:

* **Core** ‚Äì Consensus rules, transaction validation, block structure, cryptography.
* **Networking** ‚Äì P2P protocols, mempool, synchronization rules.
* **Standards / Interface** ‚Äì Wallet formats, RPC APIs, contract schemas.
* **Governance / Meta** ‚Äì Processes surrounding the TSP workflow and community rules.
* **Applications** ‚Äì Proposals for RGB anchoring, Lexum contracts, AMMs, DAOs, etc.
* **Layer 2 (L2)** ‚Äì Payment channels, channel factories, off-chain scaling solutions.

## üè∑ Numbering

* TSPs are assigned sequential numbers (e.g. **TSP-0001**).
* The number does not indicate importance, only order of registration.
* Example:

  * **TSP-0001** ‚Äì Support Kaspa-Compatible Payment Types with Extended Taproot
  * **TSP-0002** ‚Äì Adoption of BLAKE3 Hash Algorithm Across the Tondi Protocol
  * **TSP-0003** ‚Äì ASIC-Resistant Proof-of-Work Hash Specification Based on BLAKE3 + Light Memory-Touching
  * **TSP-0004** ‚Äì Definition of the TSP Numbering, Categories, and Lifecycle
  * **TSP-0005** ‚Äì Biannual Evolution and the Tondi Frontier Network
  * **TSP-0006** ‚Äì FUN20 ‚Äî An Inscription-style Fungible Token Standard for Tondi
  * **TSP-0007** ‚Äì ANYPREVOUT Support for Eltoo-based Payment Channels (Tondi Flash)
  * **TSP-0008** ‚Äì CISA (Cross-Input Signature Aggregation)
  * **TSP-0012** ‚Äì Channel Factories for Scalable Off-Chain Payment Networks
