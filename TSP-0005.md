### üîç Overview

This proposal redefines the **evolution rhythm** of the Tondi blockchain, moving from yearly upgrades to a **biannual upgrade cycle**.
Upgrades will no longer be tied to block height but instead bound to **DAA Score (Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm Score)** thresholds.

At the same time, the current **Tondi Testnet** will be rebranded and formalized as **Tondi Frontier**:

* A **permanent, non-resetting experimental network**;
* The **first deployment ground** for new features;
* A proving hub for **Kaspa backports, Bitcoin proposals, and Tondi-native innovations**.

Frontier will serve as both a **staging environment for production upgrades** and a **research hub for the ecosystem**.

---

### üéØ Goals

* Transition from **annual** to **biannual evolution**, accelerating feature delivery;
* Establish **Tondi Frontier** as a permanent innovation testbed;
* Reduce mainnet risk through a **Frontier-first principle**;
* Ensure Tondi stays aligned with the best of **Kaspa, Bitcoin, and internal R\&D**.

### üîß Technical Details

#### 1. Version Control via DAA Score

* Introduce the concept of a **version epoch**:

  * Each epoch ‚âà **6 months (\~180 days)**.
  * Defined by a DAA Score increment:

    ```
    ŒîDAA_threshold = average_daily_DAA √ó 180
    ```

    where `average_daily_DAA` is calculated from the prior 6 months of network activity.
* When the mainnet‚Äôs global DAA Score increases by at least one **ŒîDAA\_threshold**, the chain enters a new version epoch and triggers a **major release (vN.0)**.
* Within an epoch, the governance DAO may approve **minor releases (vN.1, vN.2 ‚Ä¶)** without changing the major version.
* **Frontier always runs one epoch ahead**: all new features must operate on Frontier for at least one full epoch (\~6 months) before being considered for mainnet activation.

#### 2. Tondi Frontier Network

* Permanent, never reset; continuous history.
* Consensus rules mirror mainnet, but new features may be **activated earlier**.
* Integrates:

  * Kaspa‚Äôs latest DAG/consensus improvements;
  * High-value but unimplemented Bitcoin BIPs;
  * Tondi-native research (RGB anchoring, PoW experiments, AMM/DAO frameworks).

#### 3. Upgrade Process

* **Frontier-first principle**: new features must run on Frontier ‚â•1 version epoch before mainnet adoption.
* **DAO governance**: decides which Frontier-tested features graduate to mainnet.
* **Format synchronization**: Frontier and mainnet share identical state formats, ensuring seamless migration and cross-testing.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

* **Network divergence**: Frontier may activate features never adopted by mainnet ‚Üí mitigated with clear labeling as ‚Äúexperimental only.‚Äù
* **Security exposure**: experimental features may face exploits ‚Üí mitigated by smaller economic incentives on Frontier.
* **Governance delay**: if DAO fails to approve upgrades ‚Üí fallback rule: at threshold crossing, a **default minor release** executes (no new major features).

### üìÖ Implementation Plan

1. **2025 Q3** ‚Äì Formalize Frontier branding; migrate existing testnet state.
2. **2025 Q4** ‚Äì Frontier activates with first set of Kaspa backports + trial of unimplemented BIPs.
3. **2026 Q1** ‚Äì First mainnet biannual upgrade triggered by ŒîDAA\_threshold.
4. **Ongoing** ‚Äì Frontier continues indefinitely, acting as staging ground for every TSP proposal.

---

### üìù Additional Notes

* Frontier is not disposable but a **permanent innovation network**.
* Developers are encouraged to deploy experimental dApps and contracts on Frontier.
* Explorers, SDKs, and tooling must treat Frontier as a **first-class network** alongside mainnet.
* Guiding philosophy: **mainnet stays conservative, Frontier stays bold** ‚Üí biannual cadence ensures balance between innovation and stability.

‚úÖ If approved, TSP-0005 will establish a **DAA-driven biannual evolution mechanism** and formalize **Tondi Frontier** as a permanent experimental network, keeping Tondi at the forefront of blockchain R\&D.

Would you like me to also add a **worked example of ŒîDAA\_threshold calculation** (using Frontier‚Äôs recent average daily DAA growth) so SDKs/clients can implement it directly?
