# **TSP-0005**: Biannual Evolution and the Tondi Frontier Network

**Proposal Number**: TSP-0005  
**Proposal Name**: Biannual Evolution Schedule and Establishment of Tondi Frontier  
**Proposal Status**: Draft  
**Author**: Tondi Foundation Development Team  
**Creation Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Target Version**: Tondi Frontier Activation(v2025b)
**Protocol Scope**: Versioning scheme, governance schedule, testnet policy, feature activation path

### üîç Overview

This proposal redefines the **versioning and evolution model** of the Tondi blockchain. Instead of yearly upgrades, Tondi will adopt a **biannual release cycle**, ensuring continuous innovation while maintaining predictability.

Simultaneously, the existing **Tondi Testnet** will be rebranded and formalized as **Tondi Frontier**:

* A **permanent, long-lived experimental network**;
* The first deployment ground for:

  * Cutting-edge **Kaspa features**;
  * High-value but unimplemented **Bitcoin proposals**;
  * Tondi‚Äôs **own novel innovations**.

Frontier will serve as both a **staging ground** for production upgrades and a **research hub** for the ecosystem, creating sustained long-term value.

---

### üéØ Goals

* Move from **annual** to **biannual evolution** for faster feature delivery;
* Establish **Tondi Frontier** as a permanent pre-mainnet proving ground;
* Reduce risk by testing consensus and application features under real-world conditions before mainnet deployment;
* Attract developers and researchers to experiment without jeopardizing mainnet stability;
* Build credibility by ensuring that Tondi is always aligned with the best ideas from **Kaspa, Bitcoin, and internal R\&D**.

### üîß Technical Details

1. **Version Control via DAA Score**

   * Tondi‚Äôs versioning will be tied to **DAA Score (Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm Score)** rather than block height.
   * Each **major release (vN.0)** occurs every \~6 months, triggered when the DAA Score crosses a preset threshold.
   * Each **minor release (vN.1)** may introduce small governance-approved adjustments within the same half-year cycle.

2. **Tondi Frontier Network**

   * Frontier will **never reset**, ensuring continuity for developers and researchers.
   * Frontier consensus rules mirror mainnet, but new features may be **activated earlier**.
   * Frontier will integrate:

     * **Kaspa‚Äôs latest consensus and DAG improvements**;
     * **Selected Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)** that remain unimplemented in Bitcoin but carry high value;
     * **Tondi-native innovations**, such as RGB anchoring, PoW research (TSP-0003), and AMM/DAO frameworks.

3. **Upgrade Process**

   * **Frontier-first principle**: all new features must run on Frontier for at least one cycle (\~6 months) before consideration for mainnet.
   * **DAO Governance**: Tondi governance DAO decides which features mature enough to move from Frontier to mainnet.
   * **Synchronization**: Frontier and mainnet share state formats, making migration and cross-testing seamless.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

* **Network divergence**: Frontier may run features never adopted in mainnet ‚Üí mitigated by clear labeling of ‚Äúexperimental only.‚Äù
* **Security exposure**: Experimental features may be exploited ‚Üí mitigated by smaller economic incentives on Frontier.
* **Governance delay**: DAO may fail to adopt upgrades ‚Üí fallback rule: default minor upgrade if no decision is reached by activation threshold.

### üìÖ Implementation Plan

1. **2025 Q3** ‚Äì Formalize Frontier branding, migrate existing testnet state.
2. **2025 Q4** ‚Äì Frontier activates with first set of Kaspa feature backports + trial of unimplemented BIPs.
3. **2026 Q1** ‚Äì First biannual upgrade on mainnet triggered by DAA Score threshold.
4. **Ongoing** ‚Äì Frontier continues indefinitely, acting as staging ground for every future TSP proposal.

### üìù Additional Notes

* Frontier is not a disposable testnet but a **permanent innovation network**.
* Developers are encouraged to deploy experimental dApps and contracts on Frontier.
* Explorers, SDKs, and tooling should treat Frontier as a first-class network, alongside mainnet.
* This proposal aligns Tondi with a **continuous innovation philosophy**: conservative in mainnet, bold in Frontier.

If approved, **TSP-0005** will establish **biannual evolution cycles** and formalize **Tondi Frontier** as a permanent experimental network, ensuring Tondi remains at the forefront of blockchain research and development.
