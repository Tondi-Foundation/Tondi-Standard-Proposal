# **TSP-0001**: Enable Taproot-only Output Structure in Tondi 

**Proposal Number**: TSP-0001  
**Proposal Name**: Enable Taproot-only Output Structure in Tondi  
**Proposal Status**: Implemented  
**Author**: Tondi Foundation Development Team  
**Creation Date**: 2024-11-05  
**Target Version**: Tondi Genesis (v2025a)  
**Protocol Scope**: Transaction validation rules, script structure, signature algorithm  

---

### üîç Overview

This proposal defines the Tondi chain as a blockchain network that **only supports Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) outputs**, specifically:

* All transaction outputs support only **Key Path Spend** (x-only public key + Schnorr signature);
* **Script Path is removed** (no support for script path spending);
* All signature validation uses the **BIP-340 Schnorr signature scheme**;
* Default address format is **Bech32m** with prefix `tondi1`.

As a foundational standard of the Tondi Genesis Protocol, this proposal aims to establish a unified and simplified base structure for future RGB contract anchoring, high-frequency transaction support, and client-side validation mechanisms.

---

### üéØ Goals

* Simplify script execution paths and reduce verification overhead;
* Enhance privacy and predictability (uniform transaction structure);
* Provide native support for the RGB protocol and Lexum architecture;
* Enable high-throughput transactions with Schnorr batch verification;
* Reduce complexity and future attack surfaces.

---

### üîß Technical Details

1. **Output Type Specification**
   All outputs must follow this structure:

   ```
   scriptPubKey = OP_1 || <32-byte x-only pubkey>
   ```

   Legacy script types such as `OP_RETURN`, `OP_CHECKSIG`, `OP_IF`, etc. are not permitted.

2. **Signature and Verification**

   * Use the BIP-340 Schnorr signature scheme;
   * All inputs must use Key Path Spend;
   * Transaction validation follows the BIP-341 key spend process;
   * Support for Schnorr batch verification and SIMD optimization (future expansion).

3. **Address Format**

   * Use BIP-350 Bech32m encoding;
   * Network prefix: `tondi1`;
   * Address length: 42 characters (including checksum).

4. **Script Path Removal**

   * Consensus rules will not parse the Taproot Merkle Root;
   * `scriptPathSpend` (witness version 1 + control block) is entirely prohibited;
   * All signature paths are treated as empty Merkle trees.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Backward Compatibility & Security

* As Tondi is a genesis chain, there are no legacy outputs to support;
* Removing Script Path significantly reduces the attack surface while leaving room for future soft fork extensions;
* Schnorr signatures and x-only public keys have been extensively tested in Bitcoin, ensuring reliability and security.


### üìù Additional Notes

Upon approval of this proposal:

* Nodes must reject any non-P2TR transaction types;
* All subsequent proposals must assume this specification as a protocol baseline.

If there are no objections, this proposal shall be included as part of the **Tondi Genesis Protocol**, numbered **TSP-0001**.
