# **TSP-0004**: Definition of the TSP Numbering, Categories, and Lifecycle

**Proposal Number**: TSP-0004  
**Proposal Name**: TSP Numbering and Categorization Specification  
**Proposal Status**: Draft  
**Author**: Tondi Foundation Development Team  
**Creation Date**: 2025-05-05  
**Protocol Scope**: Meta-process (proposal workflow, numbering, and governance rules)

### üîç Overview

This proposal defines the **Tondi Standard Proposal (TSP)** numbering system, categorization, and lifecycle process. It establishes a clear framework for how proposals are written, reviewed, accepted, and archived.

Specifically, it introduces two numbering phases:

1. **Pre-October 2025** ‚Üí Sequential numbering with format `TSP-000x`.
2. **Post-October 2025** ‚Üí Categorized numbering scheme modeled after Bitcoin‚Äôs BIP and Ethereum‚Äôs EIP classification.

This ensures both **historical continuity** (early proposals remain simple and sequential) and **scalability** (future proposals are organized by domain).

---

### üéØ Goals

* Provide a consistent and transparent numbering convention for TSPs;
* Categorize proposals by domain (consensus, networking, applications, governance, informational);
* Define the **lifecycle stages** of a TSP, from draft to final;
* Clarify editorial responsibilities and community governance of the process;
* Ensure Tondi‚Äôs proposal system can scale to long-term ecosystem growth.

### üî¢ Numbering Rules

#### **Phase 1: Early TSPs (until October 2025)**

* Proposals use **sequential 4-digit numbering**: `TSP-0001`, `TSP-0002`, ‚Ä¶
* Reserved for **Genesis Protocol specifications** and early ecosystem standards.
* Examples:

  * TSP-0001 ‚Üí Kaspa-compatible + Taproot support
  * TSP-0002 ‚Üí BLAKE3 as unified hash function
  * TSP-0003 ‚Üí ASIC-resistant PoW with memory-touch randomness

#### **Phase 2: Categorized TSPs (from October 2025 onward)**

Proposals must include a **category prefix** + numeric sequence:

* **TSP-Cxxx ‚Üí Core / Consensus**

  * Transaction validation rules
  * Proof-of-Work algorithms
  * Block structure
  * Cryptography primitives

* **TSP-Nxxx ‚Üí Networking**

  * P2P protocols
  * Gossip/mempool rules
  * DAG synchronization mechanisms

* **TSP-Axxx ‚Üí Applications**

  * RGB anchoring
  * Lexum smart contracts
  * AMM, DAO frameworks
  * Layer-2 interoperability

* **TSP-Pxxx ‚Üí Process / Governance**

  * TSP workflow and lifecycle definitions
  * On-chain/off-chain governance
  * Voting mechanisms and federation rules

* **TSP-Ixxx ‚Üí Informational**

  * Explanatory or research papers
  * Non-consensus guidelines
  * Best practices for developers

### üîÑ Lifecycle Stages

A TSP progresses through the following statuses:

1. **Draft** ‚Äì The initial proposal, open for feedback.
2. **Review / Last Call** ‚Äì Under technical review and community discussion.
3. **Accepted** ‚Äì Approved for inclusion in a future Tondi release.
4. **Implemented** ‚Äì Implemented in reference clients and/or testnet.
5. **Final (Active)** ‚Äì Successfully deployed and active on mainnet.
6. **Replaced / Deprecated (optional)** ‚Äì Superseded by another TSP but retained for history.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Editorial Process

* **Editors**: The Tondi Foundation appoints a set of TSP editors responsible for numbering, formatting, and maintaining consistency.
* **Community Review**: Drafts are published publicly for discussion and may move forward only after a community review period (minimum 2 weeks).
* **Acceptance**: Final authority for acceptance lies with the Tondi Foundation governance committee, though technical consensus is required.
* **Archival**: Finalized TSPs are immutable and archived for permanent reference.

---

### üìù Additional Notes

* All TSPs must be written in **Markdown** and submitted via pull requests to the official repository.
* Each TSP must follow the [TSP Template](./TSP-TEMPLATE.md).
* Licensing: All TSPs are published under **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)**.

---

### üìå Conclusion

This proposal, once finalized, will define the **official numbering, categorization, and lifecycle rules** for all Tondi Standard Proposals.

* **Before October 2025** ‚Üí Sequential (`TSP-000x`)
* **After October 2025** ‚Üí Categorized (`TSP-Cxxx`, `TSP-Nxxx`, `TSP-Axxx`, `TSP-Pxxx`, `TSP-Ixxx`)

This ensures clarity, consistency, and scalability for the long-term evolution of the Tondi ecosystem.
